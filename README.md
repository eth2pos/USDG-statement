# USDG-statement

**Martin Tesla: a small dream of stablecoin USDG**
Martin Tesla is born in Ottawa, Canada. He came up with a theory long time ago, about "General universal basic income". The theory indicates that  every one should get bonus of every additionally issued stablecoin in the financial system. Every time a new stablecoin is issued (with fully collaterized USD or ETH to achieve price stability), holders should get  should give a part of it, so that they could enjoy the bonus during inflation, instead of their wealth being diluted during inflation. In this case, the stablecoin will keep price stable while every holder get stable profit whenever a new stablecoin is issued. The following contract will make the theory come true:

**First Transfer Contract (FTC)**
When you received USDG, which is very much like USDT, you can tranfer to any address with any wallets. After the transfer is broadcasted, the mutual relationship between you and your recipient is forever locked on the blockchain by FTC. 
Take the following as an example:
When you transfer USDG to 100 new addresses, you will become the upper level of these addresses in the hierarchy.
You will get bonus rewards from every one USDG they hold, currently at 1% APY.
If these 100 addresses hold 1 USDG on average, your income is 1 USDG/year
If these 100 addresses hold 1000 USDG on average, your income is 1000 USDG/year
If these 100 addresses hold 10000 USDG on average, your income is 10000 USDG/year
Through involving more people in USDG, you could take the bonus in miniting every additional USDG, and can exchange USDG to ETH at anytime in major exchanges. 


**Goal: 2 billions USDG users**
Martin Tesla designed the FTC mechanism based on six degrees of separation. Within 6 levels of the hierarchy, every level could get rewards from the next level. 


**USDG IDO platform:**
Any entity/person will need just 3000 USDG to complete a new crowdfunding IDO in the platform, just like Polkastarter or DuckDAO and any other IDO platforms. When the progress bar goes from 0% to 100%, the IDO is complete. 
We aim to help 1 million quality projects go public with USDG IDO platform. 


**World's first stablecoin public blockchain by USDG:**
USDG will puslish the world's first block chain powered by stablecoin. The communication on chain is not through internet, but through distributed network and satellite signals. 


**ETH2POS staking contract:**
USDG price stability and issuance is fully collateralized by the new ETH constantly rewaraded from ETH2.0 staking pools. 
It's world's first crypto-collateralized stablecoin backed by ETH2.0 staking rewards. Our foundation will work closely with Vitalik in this opportunity. 


**Every USDG is fully backed by ETH, 1:1 to USD. **
Top 10 USDG holder addresses are addresses with big amount of ETH or USDC. You can search USDG holders on etherscan:
